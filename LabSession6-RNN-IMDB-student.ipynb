Sadly the movie is weak, and fails to portrait the true essence of the characters, what's so great about the book is that you're able to know and understand the background stories, therefore you identify with the characters behavior to the point where you even forget they're mobsters!! however in the movie many minor and irrelevant scenes take too much time, time that could be used to go a little deeper into the characters, and what's even worst is the total disregard to important passages of the book which didn't even make the movie, or if they did, they were over-synthesized. I don't think I'm the only one that really loved the book, but was sadly disappointed by the movie, still is a movie worth watching, but if you really want to enjoy a great story you should read the book!!*\n",

    "Here, we also introduce the notion of [embedding](http://dmlc.ml/rstats/2017/10/11/rnn-bucket-mxnet-R.html). Embedding turns positive integers (indexes) into dense vectors of fixed size. eg. [[4], [20]] -> [[0.25, 0.1], [0.6, -0.2]]. In this last example, we transform the sequence of indexes 4 and 20 into real vectors respectively (0.25, 0.1) and (0.6, -0.2). The idea of embedding is to project the indices into another space that is more informative. For instance, words with similar meaning will be close in this new space.\n",
